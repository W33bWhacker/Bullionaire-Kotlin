# Overview

This is the first software I wrote using the Kotlin to familiarize myself with the language before creating an android app in Android Studio. The software I wrote here is a text-based version of the android app I plan to create.

This software and the app I intend to create makes a particular complication or task simple for me, and hopefully it will for more people that share the same complication. This software is meant for bullion investors. Often, when we are looking for the best price to buy precious metals from so many different dealers, it can be overwhelming to do the research and the calculations yourself to judge which dealers have the best price and what form of bullion(bars, coins, etc...) of a type of precious metal(gold, silver, etc...) is the best price for the amount you are looking to spend. This software conveniently cuts out the hours you could spend doing all the calculations that help an investor determine "Which type of bullion should I buy?" and "Which one is the best price?", when it is hard to know simply by looking at the prices given. Just simply punch in the information of the different types of bullion you think you should buy and the app will line up the important numbers, like price per Oz and price over spot, to help you be confident about your decision!

Installed IntelliJ Idea as IDE for Kotlin.

Used Kotlin programming language along with Java Utilities for Scanner and ArrayList frameworks.
